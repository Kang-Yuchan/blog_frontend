                In college, I met a friend at a computer club who was showing a
                really cool application where you can swipe between different
                types of clothing!\nBeing very intrigued, I asked my friend if
                there is any way I can help out and join the team! After some
                thinking, he told me to finish an assignment, and then they will
                consider me. Over the weekend, I finished the assignment and was
                right away told I can join the team, though I would be working
                for free. That was completely fine for me!
