            <h2 class="description-title">My first job as developer</h2>
            <p class="description-main">
              In college, I met a friend at a computer club who was showing a
              really cool application where you can swipe between different
              types of clothing!\nBeing very intrigued, I asked my friend if
              there is any way I can help out and join the team! After some
              thinking, he told me to finish an assignment, and then they will
              consider me. Over the weekend, I finished the assignment and was
              right away told I can join the team, though I would be working for
              free. That was completely fine for me!

            <h2 class="description-title">I LOVE JavaScript</h2>
            <p class="description-main">
              I have been using JavaScript since the beginning of my coding
              career! I used it to build simple websites and I used it to build
              large scale applications! Now I use it to teach others, as well as
              create large applications. The possibilities of this language are
              endless, and the use cases keep increasing every single day!

            <h2 class="description-title">Why learning coding is important?</h2>
            <p class="description-main">
              Nowadays with everything being electronic, everything needs to be
              programmed! From computers, to cars, machines, or anything else it
              most likely requires programming! So as a result, demand for
              coders keeps increasing year by year, due to all these
              technological advances!
